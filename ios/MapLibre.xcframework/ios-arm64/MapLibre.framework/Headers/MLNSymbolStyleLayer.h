 An `MLNSymbolStyleLayer` is a style layer that renders icon and text labels at

 These features can come from vector tiles loaded by an `MLNVectorTileSource`
 object, or they can be `MLNShape` or `MLNFeature` instances in an
 `MLNShapeSource` or `MLNComputedShapeSource` object.

 You can access an existing symbol style layer using the
 `-[MLNStyle layerWithIdentifier:]` method if you know its identifier;
 otherwise, find it using the `MLNStyle.layers` property. You can also create a
 new symbol style layer and add it to the style using a method such as
 `-[MLNStyle addLayer:]`.

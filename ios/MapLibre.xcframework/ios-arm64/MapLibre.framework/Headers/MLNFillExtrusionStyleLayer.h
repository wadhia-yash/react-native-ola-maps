 An `MLNFillExtrusionStyleLayer` is a style layer that renders one or more 3D
 extruded polygons on the map.
 
 Use a fill-extrusion style layer to configure the visual appearance of polygon
 or multipolygon features. These features can come from vector tiles loaded by
 an `MLNVectorTileSource` object, or they can be `MLNPolygon`,
 `MLNPolygonFeature`, `MLNMultiPolygon`, or `MLNMultiPolygonFeature` instances
 in an `MLNShapeSource` or `MLNComputedShapeSource` object.

 You can access an existing fill-extrusion style layer using the
 `-[MLNStyle layerWithIdentifier:]` method if you know its identifier;
 otherwise, find it using the `MLNStyle.layers` property. You can also create a
 new fill-extrusion style layer and add it to the style using a method such as
 `-[MLNStyle addLayer:]`.

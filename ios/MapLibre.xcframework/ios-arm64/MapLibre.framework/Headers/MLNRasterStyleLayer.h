/**
 An `MLNRasterStyleLayer` is a style layer that renders georeferenced raster
 imagery on the map, especially raster tiles.
 
 Use a raster style layer to configure the color parameters of raster tiles
 loaded by an `MLNRasterTileSource` object or raster images loaded by an
 `MLNImageSource` object. For example, you could use a raster style layer to
 render <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/satellite/">Mapbox Satellite</a>
 imagery, a <a
 href="https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/tileset/#raster-tilesets">raster
 tile set</a> uploaded to Mapbox Studio, or a raster map authored in <a
 href="https://tilemill-project.github.io/tilemill/">TileMill</a>, the classic
 Mapbox Editor, or Mapbox Studio Classic.
 
 Raster images may also be used as icons or patterns in a style layer. To
 register an image for use as an icon or pattern, use the `-[MLNStyle
 setImage:forName:]` method. To configure a point annotation’s image, use the
 `MLNAnnotationImage` class.

 You can access an existing raster style layer using the
 `-[MLNStyle layerWithIdentifier:]` method if you know its identifier;
 otherwise, find it using the `MLNStyle.layers` property. You can also create a
 new raster style layer and add it to the style using a method such as
 `-[MLNStyle addLayer:]`.

 #### Related examples

 an image</a> and <a
 href="https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/maps/examples/source-custom-raster/">Add

 An `MLNLineStyleLayer` is a style layer that renders one or more stroked
 polylines on the map.
 
 Use a line style layer to configure the visual appearance of polyline or
 multipolyline features. These features can come from vector tiles loaded by an
 `MLNVectorTileSource` object, or they can be `MLNPolyline`,
 `MLNPolylineFeature`, `MLNMultiPolyline`, or `MLNMultiPolylineFeature`
 instances in an `MLNShapeSource` or `MLNComputedShapeSource` object.

 You can access an existing line style layer using the
 `-[MLNStyle layerWithIdentifier:]` method if you know its identifier;
 otherwise, find it using the `MLNStyle.layers` property. You can also create a
 new line style layer and add it to the style using a method such as
 `-[MLNStyle addLayer:]`.

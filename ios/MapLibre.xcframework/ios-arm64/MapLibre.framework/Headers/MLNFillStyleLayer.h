/**
 An `MLNFillStyleLayer` is a style layer that renders one or more filled (and
 optionally stroked) polygons on the map.
 
 Use a fill style layer to configure the visual appearance of polygon or
 multipolygon features. These features can come from vector tiles loaded by an
 `MLNVectorTileSource` object, or they can be `MLNPolygon`, `MLNPolygonFeature`,
 `MLNMultiPolygon`, or `MLNMultiPolygonFeature` instances in an `MLNShapeSource`
 or `MLNComputedShapeSource` object.

 You can access an existing fill style layer using the
 `-[MLNStyle layerWithIdentifier:]` method if you know its identifier;
 otherwise, find it using the `MLNStyle.layers` property. You can also create a
 new fill style layer and add it to the style using a method such as
 `-[MLNStyle addLayer:]`.
